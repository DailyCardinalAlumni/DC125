Tom just completed his 27th season covering the Green Bay Packers for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. In addition to his daily beat responsibilities, he does a weekly in-season Xs and Os video with former Packers safety LeRoy Butler, connects with readers through a game day live blog and sabotages people's weekly pools with his atrocious NFL pick recommendations. He has been on the beat so long he remembers when the Packers were looking for a quarterback. 

Tom began his rewarding tenure at the Daily Cardinal writing stories for the intramural page and spent the majority of the five years it took him to eke out a Bachelor's degree writing, editing, typesetting, cleaning the presses and looking for a typewriter that had a sufficient number of working keys. After graduation, he joined the Milwaukee Sentinel as its UW sports reporter. He finally left Madison in 1989 to cover the Packers and in the years to follow survived the paper's merger, IPO, reorganization and sale. 

Tom is a proud member of the Newspaper Guild, for which he has served as Local 51 (Milwaukee) president since 2010. He has helped negotiate numerous collective bargaining agreements but hasn't been able to save nearly the number of jobs he would have liked. He and his partner, Janet, live in Milwaukee with a dog and a cat. In his spare time, Tom plays softball, coaches Little League, tends to the garden and urges any bird that isn't a sparrow to visit his numerous feeders.

Herman Baumann is coming to the end of his third year as President of the Daily Cardinal Board. On his way to a BA in Journalism from UW-Madison in 1975, he worked at The Daily Cardinal as a reporter on the city, campus and state beats and as copy editor. He currently sits on the boards of the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism, Wisconsin Collegiate Media Association, and the Daily Cardinal Alumni Association. He also serves on the Board of Visitors of the UW-Madison College of Letters and Science. 

Baumann recently retired from the marketing and sponsorship company he founded in 2006. His career includes an 11-year stint as editor and managing editor of Chicago Suburban Times Newspapers, a career in health care marketing with Childrens Memorial Hospital (Chicago), developing first-of- their-kind national wellness programs with Voluntary Hospitals of America (Dallas), and developing sponsorship programs and developing new products and services for the American Hospital Association. His first job was with theVilas County News-Review and Three Lakes News in Eagle River, Wis., which was the result of fellow Cardinal staffer Dick Satran recommending Baumann to his father, the late Dan Satran, Sr., who was the publisher.

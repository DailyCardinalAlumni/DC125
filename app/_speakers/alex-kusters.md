Alex Kusters of Impact Networking has dedicated himself to the competitive and rewarding field of business management within the highly competitive arena of business process optimization. Alex served on the Daily Cardinal in the 2008 academic year as the Billing & Collections Manager, and in the 2009 academic year as the Business Manager. 

Alex received his Bachelor of Science degree in Economics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He currently holds a Partner-level position at Impact as the Sales Manager of the Madison and Rockford branches.

Alex has in-depth knowledge of the rapidly evolving sales landscape, especially in terms of increased access to information for both the potential buyer and the salesperson. In this environment, buyers are much closer to making a decision based on the extensive research they often perform in the B2B space. The salesperson has access to specialized information that allows them to be more knowledgeable about their products and services. 

In this way, the customer is in the driver’s seat of the sale, and the salesperson serves as the navigator. Alex began working at Impact in 2010, and has worked exhaustively to become one of the youngest Partners in company history. He has conducted over 50,000 prospecting calls which have resulted in over 2,000 new client meetings. 

Under Alex’s leadership, his branches have seen a 5-year compound growth rate of 28%. That growth afforded the addition of another branch in Rockford. He serves as a guest lecturer for sales courses at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh, and is an avid runner in his spare time.

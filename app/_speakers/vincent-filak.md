In 2016, Filak received the Distinguished Four-Year Newspaper Adviser award from the College Media Association for his work with the Advance-Titan, UWO’s student newspaper. CMA previously honored him as an Honor Roll Recipient for his work as the adviser of the Daily News at Ball State University in Muncie Indiana.

His efforts landed him on the list of the paper’s 110 Most Notable Alumni, which was released in 2002.

Julie Betts Testwuide, a photographer and artist for over three decades, began her career as a staff photographer for the Daily Cardinal in 1980. After completing her bachelor’s degree in 1979, she spent a year of teaching. Returning for her Master’s degree in 1980, Julie studied photojournalism under James Fosdick and Fritz Albert while working at the Daily Cardinal. These experiences gave her the skills and portfolio to head to NYC to begin her career as aprofessional photographer.

Julie enjoyed a successful career, first as a staff photographer and then as a freelancer working for major corporations, publications, and sporting events across the country. From the top of the Verrazano Bridge at the NYC Marathon to photo shoots of celebrities, corporate executives, factory workers and athletes, Julie honed her technical skills in the field and in the darkroom.

In the mid 90’s Julie branched into fine art photography. She has won many awards for her unique and creative work and has exhibited in galleries worldwide. Aiming for a dreamy, ethereal look, her work was described in the New York Times, "Testwuide uses several techniques that make her photographs look like paintings by Monet or Pissarro”. Her work is included in many private collections and can be found on display in public spaces around the country as well as in a museum in Europe.

Julie is currently working on a book titled, American Porch Life. She has captured images of porches over the past 25 years traveling from coast to coast. The images not only show the architecture of porches, but also depict how we use this transitional space for enjoyment, decoration, and storage. She is currently interviewing publishers for her book.

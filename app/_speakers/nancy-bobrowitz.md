Nancy Bobrowitz is Senior Director, Global Initiatives, in the Office of Alumni and Development at Columbia University. In this role she builds support for the university and its individual schools, centers and institutes by securing donations from alumni and foundations based in Europe. In addition, she is responsible for raising funds for the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which works to preserve and expand the freedoms of speech and the press in the digital age through strategic litigation, research, and public education. 

The Institute was created as an answer to the digital revolution, the rise of new technology giants, the waning power and resources of traditional media companies, emerging challenges to investigative journalism, the reach of the surveillance agencies, and the promise of new communications platforms.

She came to Columbia in 2004 following a career in financial journalism and communications at the news and information company now known as Thomson Reuters. Her last role at Reuters was Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications for the Americas, where she was the principal contact point for the US investment community as well as for American reporters writing about the company. 

She was based at Reutersâ€™ headquarters in London for nine of the 20+ years she worked at the company, and covered financial markets in both New York and London for Reuters. Previously she worked at the Chicago Tribune. Bobrowitz is from Wisconsin, and has a BA in journalism and political science from the University of Wisconsin.

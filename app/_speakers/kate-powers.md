Kate Powers began her television career as an intern on the first season of Mad Men, researching everything from the historically accurate pronunciation of “kaiten” to 1960s salaries. In 2008, she joined Breaking Bad as writers’ P.A. and showrunner’s assistant, eventually working as writers’ assistant through Season Four. She joined Rectify in its first season as a writers’ assistant, going on to co-write the WGA-nominated Ep. #204 (“Donald the Normal”) with Executive Producer Ray McKinnon. She returned as a staff writer for the Peabody-Award- winning Rectify’s last two seasons. She is currently teaching a course in hour-long drama at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts.

Along the way, she’s worked as an assistant on a number of series, including The Good Wife, UnReal, Red Widow and Quarry; written a Breaking Bad webisode featuring a hideous white tuxedo; blogged as radiology technician-slash- loving wife Marie Schrader and overwhelmed teenager Jared Talbot (although not at the same time); and created a Serial-style podcast about the Hanna Dean murder. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a double major in philosophy and English and has an MFA in Screenwriting from USC’s School of Cinematic Arts.

She lives in Santa Monica with her husband Michael Gerber, editor and publisher of the acclaimed humor quarterly The American Bystander.

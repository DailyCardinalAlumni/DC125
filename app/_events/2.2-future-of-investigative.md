room: Vilas 4008

description: "Our panelists will discuss how investigative journalism can break through #FakeNews and the willingness of audiences to buy into conspiracies. This requires learning media literacy and how investigations need to be relevant to peopleâ€™s lives. Stories such as the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks are completely incomprehensible for a single person, or even a single news organization (or even a single country) to work on alone. Investigative journalism needs to flow from our daily coverage of institutions and people, not substitute for it."

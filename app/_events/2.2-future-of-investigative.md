description: "What is the future of investigative journalism? Thatâ€™s a loaded question. Our panelists will be discussing how such work can break through #FakeNews and the willingness of audiences to buy into conspiracies. They believe in the need to teach media literacy in school and that investigations have to be really, really relevant to people's lives. Stories such as the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks are completely incomprehensible for a single person, or even a single news organization (or even a single country) to work on alone. Investigative journalism needs to flow from our daily coverage of institutions and people, not substitute for it."

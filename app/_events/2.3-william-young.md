description: "What makes a student create a life's work at 22 only to leave it behind two months later? William Wesley Young, a native of Monroe, Wis., graduated from UW-Madison in 1892 after founding The Daily Cardinal student newspaper that April. He was the UW's first journalism major in the 1890's through the English Department, prior to the start of the School of Journalism. William Wesley Young's great-great niece will introduce you to the Bill's life as a journalist and filmmaker."

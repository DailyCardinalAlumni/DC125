description: "The *idea* of a well paid staff job is a pipe dream. What do you do if your goal is to make images?"

---

 The industry is at an interesting point. Well produced and difficult photojournalism is lauded, spread across the world in hours, and has impact in policy that many could only formerly dream of. It is also underfunded, ignored and, unless you or your family is independently wealthy, not really possible to make a living at any more (to be brutally honest). The New York Times has not hired a new staffer in almost ten years, so even the *idea* of a well paid staff job is a pipe dream. What do you do if your goal is to make images? What do we do about the abuse in the system?

description: "Well-produced and difficult photojournalism is lauded, spread across the world in hours, and has impact in policy that many could only formerly dream of. It is also underfunded and ignored. The New York Times has not hired a new photographer in almost ten years; the idea of a well-paid staff job is a pipe dream. What do you do if your goal is to make images? What do we do about the abuse in the system? Three photojournalists will share their experiences, social and professional challenges and answer questions from the audience."

description: "Freelancing has its perks (flexibility and independence) and challenges (unpredictable pay and workload) which still defines freelance work. As newsrooms shrink, publications rely more on freelancers to fill special sections and daily news holes. Our speakers will discuss how editors and writers navigate an increasing reliance on freelancers:
- How to create meaningful work relationships
- How to approach topics like deadlines and pay
- How new freelancers can succeed when writing cold pitches"

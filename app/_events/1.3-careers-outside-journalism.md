description: "The skills acquired in journalism are translatable, scalable and applicable across many different disciplines. Journalists by nature of their work as story tellers are qualified to move on to a wide range of other roles.; yet journalists often fail to realize this and end up minimizing their opportunities and skill sets. In a data focused and infused world, such story telling communication skills are more important than ever. They are the art behind the science and our panelists are here to share where journalism took them in their career."

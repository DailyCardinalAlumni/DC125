description: "We teach and work a field where people have more choices but cannot distinguish between what makes for good or bad (or fake) news. The goal of a good internet operation/digital operation should be the same as any other media outlet worth its salt: Find relevant, useful and interesting content, provide it in an audience-centric fashion and do it on platforms that best engage the readers/viewers. To be successful in such an environment, you need to thrive on change and possess a range of skills that go beyond traditional journalism.

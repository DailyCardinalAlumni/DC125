description: "The perks and challenges that have always described freelancing -- flexibility and independence, but also unpredictability in payment and work load, continue to define how freelancers work today. But as newsrooms continue shrinking, publications are increasingly relying on freelance photographers and writers to fill special sections or even daily news holes. Bill Andrews, an editor at Discover Magazine, and Hannah Furfaro, a science writer in New York City, will discuss how editors and writers navigate new challenges that come with an increasing reliance on freelancers. We'll cover how editors and freelancers can create meaningful work relationships, how both sides should approach topics like deadlines and pay, and how new freelancers can find success when writing cold pitches."

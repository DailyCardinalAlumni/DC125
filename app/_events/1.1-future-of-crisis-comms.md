description: "Major news stories are misreported or unreported because many journalists fail to understand how government works.​ Good government reporting includes learning all the “mechanics” of government relative to the story. One of the biggest challenges faced is how the speed of information sharing has drastically altered how companies and organizations respond during a crisis. Our speakers have worked in and covered government."

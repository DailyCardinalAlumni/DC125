description: "Fake news is not new, but its rampant monetization and politicization is, not just in the U.S. but globally. A former 60 Minutes producer and current professor will talk about “fake news.” Does the term itself distract from its real dangers? What can journalists, educators and citizens do to recognize all forms of fake news, combat them, and effectively neutralize them before more sophisticated digital technologies erase the already thin lines between truth and dangerous fiction?"
